# Market Analysis (Quick Glance)

## Ecosystem Map
- PearCom: premium consumer devices, security reputation, strong brand lock-in.
- SoftCom: enterprise software + AI lead, weak consumer hardware track record.
- Silicore: sole trusted secure chip supplier; capacity is the main bottleneck.
- OpenAIco: AI brain trust; distribution depends on partners.
- AmeriShop: dominant consumer retailer; controls demand visibility.
- CorpSolutions: enterprise integration gatekeeper; controls enterprise access.

## Critical Dependencies
- PearCom Enterprise Pivot requires:
  - CorpSolutions Integrator for enterprise access
  - AI access from SoftCom AI Arms Dealer or OpenAIco Open Model/Hardware Integration
  - At least 15 chips (50% of 30)
- SoftCom Hardware Blitz requires:
  - AmeriShop Premium Partner (retailer access)
  - At least 20 chips (50% of 40)
- Silicore Split Fab:
  - Yield roll can cut capacity to 60 in a round
- OpenAIco Hardware Integration:

## Chip Pressure Points
- Total demand at full load: PearCom 90 + SoftCom 40 = 130
- Base capacity: 100
- Shock A capacity: 60
- Starvation rule triggers at <50% of required chips

## Retail Leverage
- AmeriShop Premium Partner:
  - Takes 25% of target gross revenue
  - Gives target +1 die roll
- AmeriShop Private Label:
  - Target loses 3B gross and -1 die roll
- CorpSolutions Integrator:
  - Takes 25% of target gross revenue
  - Grants enterprise access
- CorpSolutions Migration Agent:
  - Target pays 6B bounty; opposing manufacturer loses 5B
  - Vetoes opposing enterprise strategy

## Shock Summary (Round 2)
- Shock A: Capacity forced to 60
- Shock B: AI-heavy strategies get -2 roll; privacy-first get +1
- Shock C: 3B fine for exclusive/partner strategies

## Incentive Patterns
- PearCom does best when it controls chips and keeps enterprise access aligned.
