# SoftCom Systems (Role Card - Draft)

## Who You Are
You are the enterprise giant. You dominate cloud, productivity, and AI via OpenAIco, but your consumer hardware track record is weak. Your challenge is to enter hardware without collapsing under risk.

## Advantages
- Deep enterprise relationships and distribution power
- AI leadership through OpenAIco
- Strong corporate lock-in across industries

## Disadvantages
- Weak consumer device credibility
- Exposed to supply chain constraints
- AI integration risks backlash in security-sensitive markets

## Super Power: The Bundle
- If CorpSolutions refuses to sell your hardware, their revenue is cut by 3B (cloud license pressure).
- In the simulator, this applies when you choose Hardware Blitz and CorpSolutions is not Integrator_SoftCom.

## Strategic Options

| Option | Upfront Cost | Chips Needed | Gross Revenue | Die | Dependencies / Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware Blitz | 8 | 40 | 25 | Standard | Requires AmeriShop PremiumPartner_SoftCom. Needs >=20 chips. Enterprise-tagged. Shock B gives -2 die roll. |
| AI Arms Dealer | 2 | 0 | 10 | Standard | Requires PearCom Enterprise Pivot or Partner w/ SoftCom. |
| Stay Software | 0 | 0 | 6 -> 5 -> 4 | None | Declines by 1 per round (melting ice cube). |

## Notes for Negotiation
- Hardware Blitz is high upside but fails without retailer access and chips.
- Arms Dealer creates leverage over PearCom but requires a buyer.
- Staying pure software is safest early, but decays over time.
