# PearCom, Inc. (Role Card - Draft)

## Who You Are
You are the consumer king. Your brand stands for premium design, privacy, and security. You dominate consumer devices but have a weak enterprise footprint. Your challenge is to defend your fortress or pivot into enterprise without losing your core.

## Advantages
- Strong consumer loyalty and ecosystem lock-in
- Security reputation is industry leading
- Historic leverage with Silicore

## Disadvantages
- Weak AI capabilities without partners
- Limited enterprise distribution
- Supply chain exposure if chips are constrained

## Super Power: Lock-In
- You can veto Silicore from selling chips to SoftCom this round.
- Effect: SoftCom gets 0 chips; Silicore loses 2B revenue.

## Strategic Options

| Option | Upfront Cost | Chips Needed | Gross Revenue | Die | Dependencies / Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Fortress | 3 | 90 | 12 | None | Safe. Needs >=45 chips to avoid failure. Shock B gives +1 to die if any roll is used. |
| Enterprise Pivot | 5 | 30 | 22 | Standard | Requires CorpSolutions Integrator_PearCom and AI access (SoftCom AI Arms Dealer or OpenAIco Open Model/Hardware Integration). Needs >=15 chips. Enterprise-tagged. Shock B gives -2 die roll. |
| Partner w/ SoftCom | 1 | 0 | 8 | None | Requires SoftCom AI Arms Dealer. Net profit split 50/50 with SoftCom. |

## Notes for Negotiation
- Enterprise Pivot is high upside but can fail if either AI or CorpSolutions is missing.
- Fortress is steady but chip-hungry; it becomes vulnerable under capacity shocks.
- Partnership is stable but forces you to share upside with SoftCom.
