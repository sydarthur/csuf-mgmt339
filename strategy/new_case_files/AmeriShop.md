# AmeriShop (Role Card - Draft)

## Who You Are
You are the dominant consumer retailer. You control demand visibility, logistics, and online sales. Your power is indirect but decisive.

## Advantages
- Control over consumer demand and distribution
- Data-driven pricing and ranking power
- Can extract rents from manufacturers

## Disadvantages
- Low margins
- Risk of being bypassed by direct sales
- Exposed to regulatory attention

## Super Power: The Algorithm
- You can boost or bury one manufacturer's die roll (+1 or -1) by adjusting search ranking.
- In the simulator, this is baked into Premium Partner (+1) and Private Label (-1).

## Strategic Options

| Option | Upfront Cost | Gross Revenue | Die | Dependencies / Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Open Market | 0 | 4 | None | Safe baseline. |
| Private Label (target PearCom or SoftCom) | 2 | 8 | None | Target loses 3B gross and -1 die roll. |
| Premium Partner (target PearCom or SoftCom) | 1 | 2 + 25% of target gross | None | Target loses 25% of gross but gains +1 die roll. Required for SoftCom Hardware Blitz. |

## Notes for Negotiation
- You can profit most by extracting a revenue share.
- You can punish a manufacturer with Private Label, but that can destabilize the ecosystem.
