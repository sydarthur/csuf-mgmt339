# OpenAIco (Role Card - Draft)

## Who You Are
You are the AI brain trust. Your models power the next wave of enterprise and consumer AI. You can deepen your SoftCom alliance, open your models to all, or go all-in on hardware integration.

## Advantages
- Best-in-class AI technology
- High demand from both consumer and enterprise markets
- Powerful leverage over platform strategy

## Disadvantages
- Heavy compute costs
- Dependent on partner distribution
- Regulatory and security scrutiny

## Super Power: Model Degradation
- If you switch partners, the old partner's next die roll suffers a -2 penalty (applies in Round 2 in the simulator if you are not SoftCom Exclusive).

## Strategic Options

| Option | Upfront Cost | Gross Revenue | Die | Dependencies / Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SoftCom Exclusive | 0 | 4 -> 3 -> 2 | None | Safe but declining each round. Subject to Shock C fine. |
| Open Model | 2 | 12 | OpenModel | Roll table: 1=0x, 2-3=0.5x, 4-6=1.0x. Shock B gives -2 die roll. |
| Hardware Integration | 4 | 20 | HW Integration | Roll table: 1-3=0x, 4-6=1.0x. Requires PearCom Enterprise Pivot. Shock B gives -2 die roll. |

## Notes for Negotiation
- Open Model is the balanced play with moderate upside and controlled risk.
- Hardware Integration is boom or bust and depends on PearCom's pivot.
- Staying exclusive to SoftCom becomes less valuable over time.
