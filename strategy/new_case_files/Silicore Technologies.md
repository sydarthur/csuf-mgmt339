# Silicore Technologies (Role Card - Draft)

## Who You Are
You are the chokepoint of secure hardware. Regulations make your chips the only trusted option for premium security. Everyone needs you, but capacity is limited.

## Advantages
- Monopoly-like control of trusted chip supply
- Strong regulatory standing
- Historic partnership with PearCom

## Disadvantages
- Capacity constraints create hard trade-offs
- Breaking exclusivity damages long-term contracts
- High capital costs to scale

## Super Power: Allocation Priority
- In a shortage, you choose who gets chips.
- You can demand bribes to prioritize a customer (GM adjudication).

## Strategic Options

| Option | Upfront Cost | Gross Revenue | Allocation | Die | Dependencies / Effects |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PearCom Exclusive | 2 | 10 | 90 Pear / 10 Soft | None | Stable. SoftCom is starved. Shock B gives +1 die roll if any roll is used. |
| Split Fab | 3 | 15 | 50 Pear / 50 Soft | Yield Roll | On yield fail (roll 1-3), capacity drops to 60 for the round. |
| Spot Market | 0 | 8 | Auction | None | Allocation by spot market; methods are proportional or highest-bidder in the simulator. |

## Notes for Negotiation
- Your allocation can make or break both giants.
- Under capacity shocks, your power spikes dramatically.
