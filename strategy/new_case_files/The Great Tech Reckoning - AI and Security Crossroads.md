# The Great Tech Reckoning - AI and Security Crossroads (Draft)

## Background
It is 2025. Two American giants sit at the center of a shifting tech landscape:

- PearCom: consumer king, premium devices, trusted security brand.
- SoftCom: enterprise giant, cloud and productivity dominance, AI leader via OpenAIco.

Their fate depends on a network of chokepoints:

- Silicore: the only trusted source of secure chips.
- OpenAIco: the AI brain trust.
- AmeriShop: consumer retail gatekeeper.
- CorpSolutions: enterprise distribution gatekeeper.

Global competition is rising (especially in Asia), regulators are tightening standards, and AI integration has created both massive upside and new risks. Each company must choose a strategy with clear costs, dependencies, and uncertain payoffs.

## Core Mechanics (Game Master Summary)
- Each team selects one option each round.
- Options may require partners or minimum chip allocation.
- Risky options use a d6 multiplier:
  - 1: 0x revenue
  - 2-3: 0.5x revenue
  - 4-5: 1.0x revenue
  - 6: 1.5x revenue
- Chip starvation rule: If a manufacturer receives <50% of required chips, its revenue is 0.

## Round 2 Shock (GM roll)
After Round 1 strategies are revealed, the GM rolls a d6:
- 1-2: Shock A (Supply Chain Fracture)
- 3-4: Shock B (Deepfake Scandal)
- 5-6: Shock C (Antitrust Decree)

Shocks apply only in Round 2.

## Shock A: Supply Chain Fracture
- Silicore capacity forced to 60 units for the round.
- Starvation rule still applies.

## Shock B: Deepfake Scandal
- Roll modifiers for Round 2:
  - -2 to SoftCom Hardware Blitz, PearCom Enterprise Pivot, all OpenAIco options
  - +1 to PearCom Fortress, Silicore PearCom Exclusive

## Shock C: Antitrust Decree
- $3B fine in Round 2 for:
  - Silicore PearCom Exclusive
  - OpenAIco SoftCom Exclusive
  - AmeriShop Premium Partner
  - CorpSolutions Integrator

## Strategic Tension
- PearCom wants enterprise access and AI, but risks weakening its consumer fortress.
- SoftCom wants hardware control, but needs chips and a retailer to avoid a costly failure.
- Silicore must balance capacity, bribes, and exclusivity.
- OpenAIco can chase growth at the risk of backlash or lawsuits.
- AmeriShop and CorpSolutions can extract value by choosing sides or staying neutral.

This is a game about leverage, timing, and asymmetric dependencies.
