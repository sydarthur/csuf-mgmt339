## **Strategic Options**

1. **Stay Loyal to SoftCom** – _Deepen Partnership_

    - **Upside:** Stable, focused relationship, guaranteed enterprise adoption.
        
    - **Risk:** Miss out on PearCom’s huge consumer base and can force them towards in-house solutions. 
        
    
2. **Open Access** – _License to Both_
    
    - Offer AI models to both SoftCom and PearCom (with revenue sharing).
        
    - **Upside:** Maximum growth, diversification.
        
    - **Risk:** SoftCom may retaliate; PearCom may undercut with in-house AI later.
        
    
3. **Switch Sides** – _Exclusive Deal with PearCom_
    
    - Break exclusivity with SoftCom; align with PearCom’s devices.
        
    - **Upside:** Massive consumer market, chance to be the brain behind secure AI devices.
        
    - **Risk:** SoftCom cuts ties, losing enterprise base.
