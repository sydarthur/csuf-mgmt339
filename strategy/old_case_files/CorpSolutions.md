## **Who You Are**

  

You are the **enterprise channel kingmaker**. Corporations, hospitals, universities, and governments rely on you to design, deploy, and integrate secure IT systems. For years, you’ve been **SoftCom’s trusted distribution and integration partner**, rolling out Office, Azure, and enterprise solutions across industries.

  

But things are changing. Security concerns make PearCom’s devices suddenly attractive to CIOs and regulators. If PearCom commits to enterprise, they’ll need _you_ to succeed. You could continue to back SoftCom, pivot to PearCom, or try to play both sides — but neutrality could make you irrelevant if one ecosystem dominates.
