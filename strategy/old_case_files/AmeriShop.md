**Role Card**

  

## **Who You Are**

  

You are the **consumer storefront of the digital age**. In the US and Europe, you dominate online sales of devices and accessories. Nearly half of all PearCom devices are purchased through your channels, and you also sell a large share of SoftCom’s hardware and partner products.

  

Your logistics, data, and reach make you indispensable. But you face new threats: PearCom is experimenting with **direct-to-consumer online sales**, and SoftCom may bypass you by bundling devices directly into enterprise contracts. Meanwhile, Chinese players are pushing into online channels with lower prices.

  

The question: **Do you throw your weight behind one partner, or remain neutral?**
